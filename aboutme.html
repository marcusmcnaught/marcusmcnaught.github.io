    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! My name is Marcus McNaught, and I've
      been developing software for the past 5 years, 2 of those have been working in professional roles. But my true passion lies in the world of game development. I have spent the last 2 years working in bookmetadata processing and insurance platform developement, which has given me a broad understanding on the .NET platform. </p>
